# Firehouse Response Mapping by Fire Responseware Technologies

## Intro

This project takes on two parts. One part is the development of an data viz app and database of department response times and creates awareness of zones that may need to be mitigated and gives homeowners a sense of awareness. The second aspect is providing web sites for fire departments to allow them to communicate effectively with their communities about the services they provide and mitigate safety concerns with awareness.

## Fire House Data Vizualization

Our goal is to take the data for every apparatus in a fire house and project that out to a map of it's service area. We want to make sure department capabilities are well known and encourange mutual aide. It is also important for people to know where they lie in the fire departments average response because it is important to know being that fire dynamics are complex and the faster a fire engine can get on scene the better for the property. The goal is for this application to be integrated into existing infrastructure in automate the attainment of data automatically editing response times. We also want to go from radius circles based on response time x average speed. This way we can create a polygon that shows where the response within the district is and accurately represent the response to the geography. 

## Fire House Website Development

It is important to have a website to be accessible to the citizens a fire department serves. It is a vital source for information to prevent the occurance of fires. We want to attach the two systems together for sole ease of use. We are motivated to provide them a cost effective option to have a front facing medium with assistance to get started on social media.
